## Project Summary

This repository contains the investor-ready presentation and supporting report for **FloodShield AI** — a hybrid AI system that integrates global models (e.g., Google Flood Hub) with Pakistan’s real-time gauge network to deliver improved flood forecasts, high-resolution inundation maps, and timely actionable alerts.

The deliverables in this repo are intended for policymakers, NDMA/PDMAs, potential investors, and technical partners.
